## Create the bingo cards on the host machine

1. Bingo card algorithm
2. Map SVGs to number (also, combine for two-digit numbers)
3. Draw a graph and center the SVGs
4. Save as a png

### Other Considerations

Maybe we should just use a web font instead of SVGs for numbers

## Interactive UI/Better Feedback Loop

Resize and move operations that immediately rerender

## Web hosting

Maybe the UI for designing the stuff shouldn't be the same one as the actually rendered png
